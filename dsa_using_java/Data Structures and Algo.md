### What is a Data Structure?
- Data Structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently. 

### Two types of Data Structures
- Linear Data Structure - The arrangement of data in the sequential manner is known as linear data structure. The data structures for this purpose are Arrays, Linked List, Stacks and queues. One element connected to only one other element.

- Non - Linear Data Structure - When one element is connected to the 'n' number of elements known as non-linear data structures like trees and graphs.

### What is an Algorithm
- It is a process or a set of rules required to perform calculations or some other problem solving operations especially by a computer. It is not a code nor a program, its just a solution of a problem. They can be of the following types - 
	- Brute Force Algorithm
	- Divide and Conquer
	- Greedy Algo

### What is a pointer?
- Pointer is used to point the address of the value stored anywhere in the computer memory. To obtain the value stored at location is knows as dereferencing pointer.
